## About
This repository contains my introduction to Python proggramming codes and i would be trying some new things and beginner level codes on python in this repository.

Python pprogramming language is a high level programming language which is also object oriented, it is easy to understand and unlike C programming language or java it does not require a (;) terminator. also, programmers in python do not need to interact with the memory as much as C programmers do, python does something called Garbage collection which automatically allocates and frees memory after use.

This repository is going to host my python based ALX task.
